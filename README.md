# School District Analysis

## Overview

### The purpose of this analysis is to see how replacing values for ninth graders in one school would affect the district analysis because evidence of academic dishonesty had been found. Specifically, we are analyzing data from standardized tests to see trends in school performance. This analysis will give insights for discusions of the schol board as well as to allow the school board to make strategic decisions in regards to the school budgets and priorities. 

## Results

### Changes in Analysis 
  * ### The School District Summary did not have noticeable changes. 
  * ### The School Summary showed the percent passing math dropping from 93.27 to 66.69, the percent passing reading dropping from 97.30 to 69.99, and the percent overall passing from 90.94 to 65.07 for Thomas High School until we remove the ninth grade entirely and then there are not noticable changes.
  * ### Replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores with NaN's affects Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools because Thomas High School's performance drops considerably as the other school's stay the same. Thomas High School's Performance would be failing. Once we take out the ninth grade scores and then compare Thomas High School again their performance relative to the other schools does not change.   
  * ### Affects of replacing ninth grade scores:
    * ### Math and reading scores by grade did not change. 
    * ### Scores by school spending showed minimal changes per percent passing math and percent passing reading; however the percent overal passing dropped from 90.63 to 80.94, approximately 10 percent. 
    * ### Scores by school size showed a slight drop for medium schools. The percent overal passing for medium schools dropped from 90.62 to 90.57.
    * ### Scores by school type did not change.

## Summary

### From our analysis we can see that replacing values for ninth graders in Thomas High School did not have a significant impact as the number of students in the ninth grade from one school in one district is a relatively small number. Most changes were only a tenth or two of a percent. Medium schools are impacted by these changes as seen with a slight percentage drop in overal passing as shown below.
